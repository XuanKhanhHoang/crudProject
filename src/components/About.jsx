        National University. I am passionate about learning and exploring new
        things, especially in the field of technology. I enjoy solving problems
        and building new products that can help people.

        During my studies, I have had the opportunity to participate in many
        projects in information technology, including developing web
        applications, designing database systems, and building artificial
        intelligence models. I have also participated in many competitions in
        information technology and have won a number of awards.

        After graduation, I hope to work in the field of technology, especially
        in the field of artificial intelligence. I believe that artificial
        intelligence has the potential to change the world in positive ways, and
        I want to be a part of that change.

        I am a sociable and approachable person. I am always willing to help
        others and I am always eager to learn new things. I believe that I will
